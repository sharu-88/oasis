        <h2>Why I Admire Lord Krishna</h2>
        <p>Lord Krishna represents the essence of love, devotion, and righteousness. His life story is a blend of divine wisdom and playful mischief, making him a beloved figure in Hindu mythology. I admire Krishna for his teachings on dharma (righteousness) and his role in the Mahabharata, where he serves as a charioteer and guide to Arjuna. His words in the Bhagavad Gita inspire me to seek truth, compassion, and selfless action in my life.</p>
